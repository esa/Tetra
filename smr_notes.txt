line 111: why quadratic hash probing?
_insert_at_index is unused

'table' arg is pattern catalog

_generate_patterns_from_centroids:
used at solve time
intention: yield 'pattern_size' subsets
of 'star_centroids' in brightness order.
TODO: add test case to demo/verify what this 
is doing.
Is there an easier way to express this?

_star_table: stars in database
_pattern_catalog: patterns in database
both are needed for 'has_database()' to be True

_pattern_largest_edge: given a pattern index,
gives the largest edge for that pattern

generate_database() hardwires pattern_size
to 4?
Key params are FOV range (small FOV=bigger DB)
and limiting magnitude.
line 566: pattern_bins = ... need comment
BCS5 uses both 1950 and 2000 coords??
Tetra3 doesn't look at the header to
determine which??
In a plate solve result, what is the RA/DEC epoch?

line 722, pattern_stars_separtion.
Used to exclude close stars from pattern.
Same heuristic used at solve time?

line 737: don't understand the 'keep_at_fov'
access in the np.any query.

line 740: else if occupied_for_pattern,
need to set involved keep_at_fov[] 
entries to False?

line 841, hash_code binning. Enter into
multiple bins if near border?

line 1103: is this the correct deprojection
of image x/y to sky unit vectors?

line 1157: what is the 1000 for?
